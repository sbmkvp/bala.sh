## About myself

I am an urban planner who has a multi-disciplinary expertise across artificial intelligence, computer science, data engineering, data science, big data analytics, geography, geographic information systems, network/graph analysis etc.
I have worked in both academia and industry for the past 10 years across almost all the above disciplines.
Currently, I am an academic at University of New South Wales, Sydney researching on application of AI in Planning.
I cook really well.
I love maintaining & customising my gear (computers, keyboards, car etc.).
I like some outdoorsy stuff camping, kayaking, hiking etc.
I love making small, interactive tools and visualisations.
I am active on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/balanaicker) which shows the kind of stuff I am usually interested in.

## About the blog

This is my personal blog.
I started writing blogs in 2005 when I was 17.
A blog was the closest thing to a webpage I could create for myself back then.
I loved the fact that I had a location on the "world wide web" with my name and picutre on it.
Social media websites kind of took this novelty out of blogs.
Slowly people's identity switched to their Orkut, Facebook, IG, GitHub etc. but I never got 100% on this bangwagon.
I have never like the fact that I had no control over these profile pages.
Moreover you can spend time creating these online identities and they can disappear with the company that hosted them.
So I have always maintained a blog for myself and planning to keep on active for the forseeable future.
